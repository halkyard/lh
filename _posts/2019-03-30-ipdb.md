## Running the ipython debuger (ipbd) from the command line

*    Download `demo.py` from [code](/assets/code/demo.py)
This has been copied from the `lib/python3.6/turtle.py`, ie the main turtle module.
*    Download a text editor like [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and look at the file.
*    Open a terminal and: `pip install ipdb`.
*    Navigate to the directory where `demo.py` is saved and launch the ipython debugger.

```
python -m ipdb demo.py

> /Users/halkypi/Downloads/demo.py(2)<module>()
      1 # Demos taken from: lib/python3.6/turtle.py
----> 2 from turtle import *
      3 import time
```

Typing `help` or `h` will open the help topics.  A number of commands have aliases, for example:

```
ipdb> h h

h(elp)
        Without argument, print the list of available commands.
        With a command name as argument, print help about that command.
        "help pdb" shows the full pdb documentation.
        "help exec" gives help on the ! command.

ipdb> h c

c(ont(inue))
        Continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered.
```

The help menu lists all the commands:

``` 
ipdb> h

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF    cl         disable  interact  next    psource  rv         unt
a      clear      display  j         p       q        s          until

c      debug      ignore   n         pp      run      undisplay
```

The commands we need to execute the code are:

| command | description
| :--- | :--- |
| list, l | show lines around current step |
| longlist, l | show more lines than list |
| continue, cont, c | execute each line until next breakpoint |
| break, b | breakpoints
| step, s | execute line, functions are called |
| return, r | execute next line but step over functions |
| Out | execute each line until the next return |

Run the `help` or `h` command on `l` and `ll` then run them in the console.

```
ipdb> h l
ipdb> h l
ipdb> l
ipdb> ll
```
