*    Download and install the gpg encryption tool for your operating system and decrypt the .gpg file using the key hidden in crypto-files.zip
*    Run through the tool kit tour

## pandas

Useful resources:

*    Jake VanderPlas:  https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/
*    Wes McKinney:  https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book 
*    Kevin Markham: https://www.dataschool.io/


Use pandas to explore the following datasets:

*    https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks

These datasets contain information about all audio-video recordings of TED Talks uploaded to the official TED.com website until September 21st, 2017. The TED main dataset contains information about all talks including number of views, number of comments, descriptions, speakers and titles. The TED transcripts dataset contains the transcripts for all talks available on TED.com.

On a typical day in the United States, police officers make more than 50,000 traffic stops. Our team is gathering, analyzing, and releasing records from millions of traffic stops by law enforcement agencies across the country. Our goal is to help researchers, journalists, and policymakers investigate and improve interactions between police and the public.
