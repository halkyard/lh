# Getting ready for Pycon 2019

I recently finshed the first draft of the legal  hackers website, it's at halkypi/lh.  Right now I'm preparing for pycon by doing the flask tutorial, I've more or less finished the pandas one.

I'm also testing an addition to .alias of lazygit: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19595067/git-add-commit-and-push-commands-in-one with this post.  We'll see if works.
