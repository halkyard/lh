## What is data science?

Data science has been [defined](https://www.edx.org/course/data-science-essentials) as:

> The exploration and quantitative analysis of all available structured and unstructured data to develop understanding, extract knowledge, and formulate actionable results.

## What is a data scientist?  

There are different kinds of data scientists.  This course has been described as an intro to data wrangling because data science is a profession in itself and clearly out of scope.  This is meant to be an introduction for people interested in learning to swim in data and collaborate with others people in that field.  In terms of the law, we can think of data as evidence over opinion, the facts.  Lawyers have been defining and refining the laws of evidence for centuries so in that sense, they are uniquely qualified.  

The discipline of data science is better defined by looking at what they do.

## What data scientists spend time doing

This looks very much like discovery in a large trial or investigation.  Trawling through mounds of evidence or unused material is a common legal experience.  However, the art of data wrangling has been taken to a whole new level in the age of big data and mass paralell processing.  There is much to learn and anyone that thinks they have a handle on current techonology are probably doing it wrong.
