This is a "Hello world" minimal site to guage interest in a 'hand on' approach to legal hacking.  It's also just a place to put: 
*    how to guides 
*    cheat sheets
*    shared learnings

The first of these is on 'Intro' page.  I'd really like to delete some of the noise on this 'minimal' Jekyll template but this should do for now.

Thanks!
